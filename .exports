# == Bash History Configuration ==
# The `.bash_prompt` keeps a `.complete_annotated_history` directory with a
# complete history of all our commands. So some of these settings are a bit
# redundant. (But bash history is just so useful!)

# Don't allow duplicate entries in the history.
export HISTCONTROL=ignoredups:erasedups

# Don't set any limits on the size of the history file.
export HISTFILESIZE=-1

# Allow upto 100,000 commands in memory. (Use -1 to just load everything.)
export HISTSIZE=100000

# Append to history instead of overwriting it.
shopt -s histappend

# Attempt to save all lines of a multiple-line command in the same history entry.
shopt -s cmdhist

# Save multi-line commands to the history with embedded newlines.
shopt -s lithist
